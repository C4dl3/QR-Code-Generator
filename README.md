# QR Code Generator

I made a QRcode generator with the library qrcode.

Try this sample to see, if it works:

<img src="sample.png" width="30%" height="30%">

### Setup
To be able to run the script you will need to install the dependencies with the following command:
```shell script
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
